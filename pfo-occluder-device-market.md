<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PFO Occluder Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Degradable PFO Occluder</li><li>Degradable PFO Occluder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PFO occluder device market is divided into two main types: non-degradable and degradable PFO occluders. Non-degradable PFO occluders are typically made from durable materials that remain in the body permanently, offering a long-lasting solution for closing a patent foramen ovale. In contrast, degradable PFO occluders are designed to be absorbed by the body over time, providing a temporary closure that may reduce long-term complications. Both types aim to prevent the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular issues associated with PFO.</p></p>
