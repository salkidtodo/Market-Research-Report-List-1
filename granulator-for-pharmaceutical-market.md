<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Granulator for Pharmaceutical Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Granulator</li><li>Wet Granulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical granulator market includes two primary types: dry and wet granulators. Dry granulators compress powder into granules without moisture, making them suitable for heat-sensitive materials. They are often used in producing tablets and capsules. Wet granulators, on the other hand, utilize a liquid binder to create granules, enhancing flowability and compressibility. This method is ideal for ensuring uniformity and stability in formulations. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing the efficiency and quality of drug manufacturing.</p></p>
