<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tissue Heart Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stented Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Stentless Tissue Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tissue heart valves market is primarily divided into stented and stentless valves. Stented tissue heart valves feature a supportive frame that helps maintain shape and facilitate easier implantation, often providing durability and stability. In contrast, stentless tissue heart valves lack this framework, allowing for more natural blood flow and improved hemodynamics. Both types are used in heart surgeries to replace damaged or diseased valves, offering patients biocompatibility and reduced risk of rejection compared to mechanical options.</p></p>
